<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
