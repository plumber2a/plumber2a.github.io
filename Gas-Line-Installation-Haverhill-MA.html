<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for locals. A PE or RA can help figure out if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
