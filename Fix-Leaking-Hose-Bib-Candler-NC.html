<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a brand-new or refurbished building is installed by experienced craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes.

When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
