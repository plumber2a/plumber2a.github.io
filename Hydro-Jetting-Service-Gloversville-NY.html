<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an impact on cleaning agent savings. The study included tests that eliminated tough soils, in addition to examining spotting and recording. Scientists found that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. That cleaning agent cost savings increases to nearly 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
