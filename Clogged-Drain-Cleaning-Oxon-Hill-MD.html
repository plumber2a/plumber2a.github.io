<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
