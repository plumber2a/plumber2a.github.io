<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
