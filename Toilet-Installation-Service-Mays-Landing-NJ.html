<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
