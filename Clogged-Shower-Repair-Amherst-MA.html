Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to resolve the issue. Other times a more extensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a potential problem with the water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also imply the water heater is near the end of its life.
