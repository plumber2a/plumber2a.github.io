<p>There are different causes for obstructions depending on where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet paper for the many part. When the toilet tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of streaming through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
