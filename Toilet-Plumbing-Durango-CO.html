<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger significant problems. Even small leaks can gradually dampen walls and floorings till they become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other allergens. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and add rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever an excellent indication.
