<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for many building contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate clinical procedure, but easy to fix. It utilizes salt to remove smells and minerals found in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and draw in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
