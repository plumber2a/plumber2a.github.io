The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
