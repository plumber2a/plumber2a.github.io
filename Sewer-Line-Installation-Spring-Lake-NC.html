<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Spring Lake NC</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals.
