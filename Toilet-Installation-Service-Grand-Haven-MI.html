<p>Sinks aren't as basic as they utilized to be. Nowadays, homeowners can pick from an excessive range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.

<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
