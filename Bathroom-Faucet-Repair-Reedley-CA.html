Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
