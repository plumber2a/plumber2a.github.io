<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
