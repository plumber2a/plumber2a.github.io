<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Olivehurst CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
