<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complicated than replacing with a various model.

As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to protect the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
