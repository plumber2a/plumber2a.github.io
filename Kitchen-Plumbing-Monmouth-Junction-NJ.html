<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

Should you experience a specialty faucet repair that requires special order parts, we can position the order and get the sink repaired as soon as the part arrives.
