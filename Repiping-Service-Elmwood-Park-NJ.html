Finally, a quality contractor will not danger working with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
