<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Hingham MA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.
