<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, rust of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration.</p>

However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
