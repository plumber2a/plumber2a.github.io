<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
