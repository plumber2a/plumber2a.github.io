<p>Many buildings are closed to the general public or have limited access in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To prevent Legionella development, these systems need to be actively managed and maintained. See details and guidance to lower Legionella development and other pathogen and deterioration concerns that occur when there is a big drop in building water use.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the supply of water pipes in a home or building. It is a complete replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of setting up a brand-new water line plumbing system. This process normally consists of getting rid of old readily available pipes and then installing the brand-new plumbing system. Requirement repiping tasks consist of installation of all new hot and cold domestic water piping from the water source to all existing faucets and fixtures. Unless specifically included in the proposition, drain replacement and components are not included.</p>
