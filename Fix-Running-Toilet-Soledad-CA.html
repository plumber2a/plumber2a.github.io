<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>High water pressure likewise harms plumbing. The water entering the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without correct pressure reduction.
