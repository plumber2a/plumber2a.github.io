<p>This is among the main and first questions that you need to ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is an important element to understand whether or not you must repipe your house.

If your house was built before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your home was built decades prior to that.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
