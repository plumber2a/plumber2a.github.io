Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
