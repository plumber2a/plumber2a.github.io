<p>Numerous chefs choose to cook with natural gas on the stove top and electric in the oven. Electric ovens tend to bake goods more equally. Natural gas is also chosen since it can be a green" or clean energy source. This nonrenewable fuel source contains 43 percent less carbon dioxide than an electricity source that is originated from coal. Many environmentalists choose gas for this reason. Ninety percent of energy produced by gas is provided to the customer through gas lines. This is an effective means to get energy to the home.</p>
