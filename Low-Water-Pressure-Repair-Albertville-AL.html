<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
