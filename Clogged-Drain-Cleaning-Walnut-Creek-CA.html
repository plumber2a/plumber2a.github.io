<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Walnut Creek CA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
