<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
