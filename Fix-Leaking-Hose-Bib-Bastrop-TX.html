Due to the large variety of toilets, we have actually fixed numerous toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are extremely accustomed to the items used and how they are installed here locally. We also have done many toilet replacements too; this is normally required when either a home owner decides to replace their toilet with perhaps a more effective one or when a toilet is merely beyond repair.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
