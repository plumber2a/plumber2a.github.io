<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You most likely know something about your drains: they take water from your tubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment facility.

That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the competence to detect an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
