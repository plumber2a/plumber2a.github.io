<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been annoyed by cloudy white areas on your meals that will not go away, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Tough water causes these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits remaining. This makes chores simpler and less irritating for everyone involved.</p>
