<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
