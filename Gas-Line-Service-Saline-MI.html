When you're all set to in fact install your garbage disposal, follow these steps listed below thanks to Lowe's task expert, Hunter Macfarlane. As you review these steps, if anything provides you pause, feel free to call in a pro. When you need it, there's no shame in getting a little assistance.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to see what you put down your garbage disposal.
