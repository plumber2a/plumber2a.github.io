Low water pressure may make your early morning shower less than invigorating.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
