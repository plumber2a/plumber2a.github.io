<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more fragile and vulnerable to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe products have higher coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as a result of temperature level change and ice development. And these distinctions determine the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs are subject to initial and regular testing and maintenance requirements to verify their continued operational efficiency.
