<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
