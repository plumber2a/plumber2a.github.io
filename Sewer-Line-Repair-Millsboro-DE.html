A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
