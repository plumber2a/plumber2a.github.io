The easiest is to purchase a filtered water pitcher from brand names such as Brita. These pitchers use charcoal filters to remove copper and calcium from your water, along with minimizing chlorine taste and smell. Merely fill the pitcher with tap water and permit it to resolve the filter. Then, it's ready to consume and take pleasure in. You can also choose to install a water filter on your sink faucet. This will filter the water and enhance its taste, while also decreasing odor. Faucet filtration systems are inexpensive and easy to install, with many models boasting one click" installation.</p>
