<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing sufficient water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention.

<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a building. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in buildings are connected effectively, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water supply. Fixtures need to be appropriately trapped, to prevent sewer gas from escaping into a buildings. Hot water heaters are also checked to make sure that they have been set up effectively, to avoid a surge.</p>
