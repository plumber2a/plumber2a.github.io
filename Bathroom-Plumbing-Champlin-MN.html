<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
