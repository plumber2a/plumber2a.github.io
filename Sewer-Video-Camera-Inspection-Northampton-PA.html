<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's usually not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a new unit. It is recommended that you have the garbage disposal changed if problems end up being more frequent with an older system. We provide a variety of affordable and highly efficient systems, and supply in advance prices prior to work starts so there are not a surprises. It is our goal to give all of our valued consumers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding areas the service they need at a price they can manage.</p>
