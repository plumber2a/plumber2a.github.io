<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's really serious if you wish to really get the most out of your financial investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Backpressure occurs when the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger normal flow to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, tub and floor drains.</p>
