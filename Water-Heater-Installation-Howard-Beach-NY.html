<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog.
