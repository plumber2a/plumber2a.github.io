<h3>Sewer Clean Out in Locust Grove Georgia</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
