<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
