<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
