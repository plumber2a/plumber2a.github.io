<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than handy, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines. Normally, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run due to the fact that it may resolve the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
