<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
