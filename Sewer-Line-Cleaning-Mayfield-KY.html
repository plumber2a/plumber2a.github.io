It is very important that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation.
