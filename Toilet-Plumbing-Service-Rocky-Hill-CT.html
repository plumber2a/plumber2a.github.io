<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize a growing number of detergent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
