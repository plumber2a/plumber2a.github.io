<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
