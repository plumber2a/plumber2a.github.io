<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
