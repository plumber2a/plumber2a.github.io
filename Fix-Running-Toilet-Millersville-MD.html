If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
