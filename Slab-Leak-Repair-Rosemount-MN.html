<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener. Generally, this is due to the fact that the system is outdated or not working appropriately. Whatever the factor, you can be losing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>
